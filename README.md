# uniformbinarysearch_go

This is a Go port of the Uniform Binary Search optimization by Donald Knuth.

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_binary_search

No specific effort has been made for making this idiomatic Go, instead it has been ported for correctness.

The code in the subdirectory C is directly lifted from the wikipedia page, it is just there so you can compile it and verify the output of the go code.

Note: In the Pascal subdirectory I have added the Pascal version by Mr. De Bruijn as well as a copy of the email in which he gives me permission to use that file.
